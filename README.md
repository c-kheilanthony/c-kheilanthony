## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a developer with a strong foundation in both hardware and software, currently specializing in full stack web development and embedded systems. I’ve worked with technologies like **Vue.js, Quasar, React, Node.js, Strapi**, and **PostgreSQL**, and my capstone project is about a **portable speech translation device** using **Python** and **Raspberry Pi**, aimed at real-time Tagalog-Cebuano communication.

As a student leader and programmer, I thrive at the intersection of functionality, design, and community impact. Whether it’s leading a project team, building scalable interfaces, or wiring up GPIOs, I enjoy solving problems from end to end.
